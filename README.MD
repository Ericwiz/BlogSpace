This Project is from the Scrimba FRONTED CAREER PATH, API Course.

In this Project, I learned the use and how manipulate API and how to use FETCH to get API.

This Project also further helped me advance my JAVASCRIPT skills as I learned and implimented new ways of writing clean and readable code.

NOTE: I didn't focus much on the styling (CSS) since the aim of this Project is to enhance my Javacript skills and of also how to use API but however I added some styling to the page to help make it a little bit neat.
